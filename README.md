We are creating a game based on the migratory and nonmigratory birds of the Delaware Bay Estuaries. The first part of the game will be a character trying to eat food and avoid predators before time or their health runs out. The second part of the game is a side scroller where the character needs to collect food, avoid predators, and make it to the final destination as depicted on the map. At the end, there will be a quiz to review what the player has learned.
